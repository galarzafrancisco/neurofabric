# NeuroFabric

## Overview
NeuroFabric is an open, extensible platform for orchestrating AI agents within an enterprise environment. It enables seamless agent-to-agent communication, observability, and lifecycle management while maintaining flexibility across different architectures and frameworks. By defining open standards and providing an optional SDK, NeuroFabric ensures that AI agents can collaborate efficiently without being locked into a specific framework.

## Goals
### 1. **Interoperability & Standards**
   - Define a universal API specification for AI agents.
   - Ensure agents can communicate via HTTP, WebSockets, and async messaging (pub/sub).
   - Propagate trace IDs across agent interactions for observability.

### 2. **Agent Discovery & Registry**
   - Maintain a centralized registry where agents self-register and expose their capabilities.
   - Enable developers to search for and integrate with existing agents easily.

### 3. **Flexible Communication Model**
   - Support both synchronous (HTTP/WebSockets) and asynchronous (pub/sub, job queues) execution models.
   - Implement an automatic fallback system for handling long-running tasks.

### 4. **Versioning & Compatibility Management**
   - Use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) to prevent breaking dependencies.
   - Provide dependency tracking so that agent owners can see which other agents rely on them.
   - Require approval from dependent agent owners before making breaking changes.

### 5. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Track agent-to-agent interactions and visualize dependencies.
   - Provide logs, tracing, and real-time analytics on performance.

### 6. **Developer Experience**
   - Offer an optional SDK for easy integration in TypeScript (with plans for other languages).
   - Provide a wizard to bootstrap new agents with best practices.
   - Automate CI/CD workflows, versioning, and deployment lifecycle management.

### 7. **Security & Access Control**
   - Implement authentication mechanisms (OAuth, API keys, JWT).
   - Enforce role-based or attribute-based access control for agents.

## Next Steps
1. Define the **NeuroFabric API standard** (OpenAPI/JSON Schema).
2. Implement the **Agent Registry** for service discovery.
3. Develop the **TypeScript SDK** for seamless integration.
4. Build the **observability system** for tracking agent interactions.
5. Design the **developer portal** for agent onboarding and management.

## Why NeuroFabric?
NeuroFabric is designed to bring the best practices of **cloud-native infrastructure** (service meshes, Kubernetes, API gateways) into the world of **AI agent orchestration**. By focusing on **standards, interoperability, and observability**, it enables organizations to scale their AI ecosystems efficiently while maintaining control and governance.
